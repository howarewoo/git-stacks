# Git Stacks

A local-first desktop workbench for Git branches and stacked pull requests.

Design rules live in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). This file covers how to run the app
and how the large-repository work is measured.

## Commands

```sh
npm ci                 # install
npm run dev            # run the app
npm run build          # typecheck + production build
npm test               # the test suite
npm run format:check   # formatting gate
npm run bench:performance  # large-repository benchmarks
```

## Performance budgets

Git Stacks is used on repositories far larger than the ones it was built
against. The budgets below are exported from
[`src/shared/performance.ts`](src/shared/performance.ts) and are the single
value used by the main process, the renderer, the tests, and the benchmark
harness. There is no second copy of a budget anywhere.

| Budget                   | Value         | Enforced by                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `STARTUP_BUDGET_MS`      | 10000 ms      | `bench:performance` → `startup`            |
| `SNAPSHOT_BUDGET_MS`     | 4000 ms       | `bench:performance` → `snapshot`, `status` |
| `HISTORY_BUDGET_MS`      | 2000 ms       | `bench:performance` → `history`            |
| `COMMIT_DIFF_BUDGET_MS`  | 3000 ms       | `bench:performance` → `commit-diff`        |
| `INTERACTION_BUDGET_MS`  | 250 ms        | `bench:performance` → `interaction`        |
| `LIST_PAGE_SIZE`         | 200 rows      | every repository-sized list                |
| `DIFF_PAGE_SIZE`         | 1000 lines    | `DiffView`                                 |
| `MAX_STATUS_BYTES`       | 8 MiB         | `listStatus`, cut on NUL record boundaries |
| `MAX_HISTORY_BYTES`      | 1 MiB         | `getHistory`, cut on NUL record boundaries |
| `MAX_DIFF_BYTES`         | 4 MiB         | `getCommitDiff`, `changedDiff`             |
| `MAX_FILE_BYTES`         | 2 MiB         | working-tree file preview                  |
| `GIT_CONCURRENCY`        | 8             | `mapWithConcurrency`                       |
| `SNAPSHOT_BRANCH_BUDGET` | 1500 branches | per-branch analysis in `getSnapshot`       |

### Benchmarks

```sh
npm run build
npm run bench:performance
```

The harness builds its own fixtures with the local `git` binary — a working tree
of 100,000 files, 3,000 branches, a 5,000-commit history, and a commit touching
5,000 files. No clone, token, or private repository is involved, so the numbers
are comparable across runs, machines, and contributors.

The `startup` measurement runs the built Electron app against the 3,000-ref
fixture. It starts before process launch and ends after the automation clicks
the pre-seeded recent repository and its first 200 branch rows complete two
animation frames. The `interaction` measurement starts at an actual search input
event in that window and ends after the filtered branch result completes two
animation frames. The separate `diff-render-ssr` measurement is server-side
rendering cost for a 1,000-line diff preview; it is not an input-to-paint budget.
CI builds first and runs Electron under Xvfb. Local runs need a display server.
Compare trend results on the same runner class and Git/Node versions, since
filesystem and process startup costs vary by machine.

It writes `benchmarks/latest.json` and appends one line per run to
`benchmarks/trend.jsonl` (capped at the last 200 runs). The `Performance budgets`
workflow runs the harness on every push and pull request, uploads `benchmarks/`
as an artifact, and fails the job when any measurement exceeds its budget.

### What the hot paths no longer do

**One config read instead of two per branch.** `getSnapshot` issued
`git config --get branch.<name>.parent` and `branch.<name>.parentTip` for every
local branch. It now reads them all in a single
`git config --null --get-regexp` pass, using the same idiom the GitHub
integration already used for tracked pull request numbers.

**A concurrency ceiling instead of one process per branch.** Parent inference and
behind-counts used `Promise.all` over every branch, forking one `git` per branch
at once. Both phases now run through `mapWithConcurrency` at `GIT_CONCURRENCY`.

**A branch-analysis budget.** `SNAPSHOT_BRANCH_BUDGET` caps per-branch
merge-base and behind probes. A branch is counted once in snapshot limits even
if both probes were needed. Beyond the budget, recorded parents remain
available, but inferred parents or behind counts can be unknown.
`snapshot.limits.branchesSkipped` counts branches with incomplete analysis;
the Branches view states this limit rather than claiming an exact comparison.

**Streaming reads instead of buffer-then-copy.** `executeCapped` retains at most
its byte cap while the child process runs, so a 100k-file status or a 5k-file
diff never allocates the full output plus a truncated copy of it. Record-shaped
output (status, history) is cut on NUL boundaries so what is kept is always well
formed.

**Incremental lists.** Branch, changed-file, pull request, stash, commit, and
stack-member lists render `LIST_PAGE_SIZE` rows and reveal the rest on request
through `useListWindow` and `ListWindowMore`. Diff regions do the same at
`DIFF_PAGE_SIZE`.

### Stale results and cancellation

`RequestGate` (renderer) and `RequestRegistry` (main) together guarantee that a
result computed for a repository, ref, or commit the window has already left is
never applied to the one it now shows:

- `openRepository` resets the gate before awaiting, retiring every in-flight
  refresh, and the main process aborts old reads before waiting for the
  repository-switch operation to enter its queue.
- `readRepository` re-checks the active repository after the read completes, not
  only before it starts.
- A newer history page or commit diff claims the same request id, which aborts
  the previous one. Cancelled reads reject with `CommandCancelled`; the renderer
  drops them instead of showing an error.
- A read cancelled while still queued in `RepositoryOperations` never starts.

### Documented limits

These are the extreme cases the app states rather than hanging or crashing on.

- **A changed-file listing past 8 MiB.** The listing is cut on a record boundary
  and `limits.filesTruncated` is set. The Working changes view says how many
  files it is showing and disables bulk stage, bulk unstage, and stash, because
  acting on a partial listing would silently skip files. Inspect individual
  files, or use an editor or the command line for the rest.
- **More branches than `SNAPSHOT_BRANCH_BUDGET`.** Reported through
  `limits.branchesSkipped`, as described above.
- **A diff past `MAX_DIFF_BYTES` or a file past `MAX_FILE_BYTES`.** The
  backend retains only the bounded preview. The desktop diff view separately
  limits rendering to the first 512 KiB of text and reveals at most 1,000 lines
  at a time. Truncated previews are labelled; inspect the complete change in
  an editor.
- **History is paged, not loaded.** A repository with a million commits is not a
  failure case: the view holds what the reader asked for.
- **An individual history entry over 1 MiB.** The reader reports a preview
  limit error instead of presenting a partial entry as the end of history.
- **Pull request enumeration follows `gh`.** The renderer reveals pull requests
  incrementally; the main process still asks the `gh` CLI for the origin's open
  and tracked pull requests in one paginated call.
